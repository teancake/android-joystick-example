# android-joystick-example
An example of the android joystick library at https://github.com/controlwear/virtual-joystick-android.

*Note: this repository has been changed to use the OFFLINE COMPILED LOCAL aar library file in the app/libs directory, instead of the online one at io.github.controlwear:virtualjoystick.*
